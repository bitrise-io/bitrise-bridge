## Changes

* __NEW RUNNER HOSTS__ : `cmd-bridge` kept as the default host, for backward compatibility, but it's now possible to use no runner host at all (call `bitrise` CLI directly), as well as a `docker` host (run `bitrise` inside a docker container). For `docker` an additional `--docker-image-id` can be, and have to be specified - `bitrise-bridge` will run `bitrise` inside a container started from the specified image.
* The `config` and `inventory` parameters are passed to `bitrise` in Base64 format directly, without writing it to a file.
* First version which has official __LINUX__ binary.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-bridge/releases/download/0.9.5/bitrise-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-bridge`!
