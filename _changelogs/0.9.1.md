## Changes

* Log tuning, make the default logs less verbose in case everything was OK but `bitrise` returned an error, which is not a tool/internal error.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-bridge/releases/download/0.9.1/bitrise-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-bridge`!
