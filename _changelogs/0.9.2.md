## Changes

* __NEW__ : `trigger` command, to invoke `bitrise trigger` instead of `bitrise run`


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-bridge/releases/download/0.9.2/bitrise-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-bridge`!
