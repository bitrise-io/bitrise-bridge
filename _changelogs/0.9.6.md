## Changes

__NEW OPTION__ : with `--docker-allow-access-to-docker-in-container` (or with the related Environment Variable: `$DOCKER_ALLOW_ACCESS_TO_DOCKER_IN_CONTAINER`) you can grant access to `docker` inside the container. This option is only accepted for `--command-host=docker`, and as printed in the `bitrise-bridge --help` you should be careful to use it!

> If enabled it'll share the docker binary & docker.sock socket with the container, and the container itself will be able to start and manage other Docker containers.

This means that **you should not** use this option in an environment you don't have 100% control over.

What's the advantage of using this option?
If you take proper care of the environment (ex: you run the container inside an ephemeral Virtual Machine)
this option grants sufficient access to the container to use tools like `docker-compose` **inside** the
container! You can use a Docker image to setup every tool you need, and just use `docker` and the related tools
inside the container, just like you would on the host.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-bridge/releases/download/0.9.6/bitrise-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-bridge`!
