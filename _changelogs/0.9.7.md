## Changes

__Configuration file__: you can now define your default configurations with a `config.json` file,
placed to: `$HOME/.bitrise-bridge/config.json`. Right now the config file can includes the
Command Host specific arguments only, you'll still have to provide
the Config Host (`--command-host`) parameter.

At this time only the `docker` command host has additional parameters, but
the format is designed to be extendable in case other command hosts
would require additional parameters.

An example configuration file, with all the available options at this time:

```
{
  "docker": {
    "image": "bitriseio/docker-bitrise-base",
    "volumes": ["/bitrise:/bitrise"],
    "allow_access_to_docker_in_container": true
  }
}
```

The `image` and `allow_access_to_docker_in_container` parameters can be
defined with command line parameters as well, just like before (`--docker-image-id`
and `--docker-allow-access-to-docker-in-container`), and if it's defined
as a command line parameter it'll overwrite the value defined
in `~/.bitrise-bridge/config.json` (if any).

The `volumes` parameter is a new one, and is only accessible through
`~/.bitrise-bridge/config.json` at the moment. `volumes` are
simple `docker` style volume mounting definitions with the
format: `/path/on/host:/path/inside/the/container`.
The specified volumes will be mounted into the container
started by `bitrise-bridge`, the
same way `docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/inside/the/container ...` does.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-bridge/releases/download/0.9.7/bitrise-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-bridge`!
